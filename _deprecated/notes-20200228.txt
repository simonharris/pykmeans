Graphing:
 - some look sort of ok
 - not sure I'm confident of what it's actually plotting...
 - - could be several thousand results in each column?
 - - why does "Features" breakdown have such a flat top?
 - and that little black tick at the top?
 
Writing:
 - ...
 - most complete is Khan 3.15
 - algs before method or vice versa? seems algs keep referring to the latter section. Is this bad style?
 - layout is annoying: will not do what I say re placement or pagebreaks
 - still not happy about algs. Even the simplest way, the list is too wide for the box
  
Misc:
 - thing about bootcamp/proficio?
 
 Sharing overleaf:
  - send some kind of invite
  - can also send a magic link (useful with free a/c, limited collaborators I guess)

Standardisation:
 - We use something that isn't z-scored. Need to understand what it is and why we chose it
 
Exps:
 - some debugging on Yuan, looks like I'm going wrong somewhere
