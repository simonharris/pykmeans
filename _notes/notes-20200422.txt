Erisoglu - addings seems ok
 - but that issue with real world (might be same as the one I mentioned)
 - does seem to come back to same points? R says impossible. Is it *really* mathematically impossible?
 - - but I get duplicates, at least based on those two features
 
 - 2 questions from Paper - ongoing list
 - - Pearson
 - - std dev over mean vs standardised data 

B&F -
 - is patented? (find link)

Realworld
 - ikmeans OK
 - just Eris

Paper 
 - labels might need some work (eg. superscript, case is inconsistent)
 
Diss (writing it)
 - havent seen any official guidelines (had to sign form saying I had!)
 - (general principle) how much detail on implementation eg. data generations: should I mention python and which libraries etc?
