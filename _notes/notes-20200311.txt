Done:
 - made some graphs wider to fit page; added many; interesting (lol ikmeans)
 - split Ikmeans into two algorithms and added to experiments
 - Yuan debugging SUCCESS. All exps run. Good results in fact
 - code vs. exps: 
 - - Yuan bugfixed and re-run (used to error on 02)
 - - SPSS - rewritten a step and re-run exps. Emailed author for source because is an odd one
 - added to paper: Yuan, SPSS...
 - playing with skmi

Paper:
X - need to agree on structure
X - - ...algorithms not a section? Surprising as large. Not really background.
 - - - whereas related work is. Is this more for a dissertation?
 - - was going to shift method before algs as algs keeps referring to the future
 - random one - not what I was getting at, (nb it is stated kmeans does this, but papers suggest Faber presented it). Steinley 2007 uses my "random"

B&F:
 - infinite loop. Not sure if going mad or what to do but have a "working" version
 - is patented! US6115708A
 - - (though the patent mentions they do have other "contemplated" approaches)
 - for now just replaced once and reran kmeans

MacQueen:
 - should probably make a decision

Ikmeans:
 - split in two
 - results: much as before, but twice :)
 - what about those other stopping conditions?
 
 Admin:
 - who was it emailed about the deadline?
 - proficio account? Good News!
