Done:
 - made some graphs wider to fit page
 - split steinley
 - Yuan debugging SUCCESS. All exps run. Good results in fact


Paper:
 - got rid of algorithms section. Surprising as large. Not really background.
 - random one - not what I was getting at, (nb he says kmeans does this, but papers suggest Faber presented it). Steinley 2007 uses my "random"


Graphs
 - added one to paper

 
Ikmeans:
 - split in two
 - results: much as before, but twice :)
