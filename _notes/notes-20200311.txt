Done:
 - made some graphs wider to fit page
 - split Ikmeans into two algorithms and added to experiments
 - Yuan debugging SUCCESS. All exps run. Good results in fact
 - code vs. exps: 
 - - Yuan bugfixed and re-run (used to error on 02)
 - - SPSS - had another shot, looks bad...email author
 - added to paper: Yuan...

Paper:
 - need to agree on structure
 - - ...algorithms not a section? Surprising as large. Not really background.
 - - - whereas related work is. Is this more for a dissertation?
 - - was going to shift method before algs as algs keeps referring to the future
 - random one - not what I was getting at, (nb it is states kmeans does this, but papers suggest Faber presented it). Steinley 2007 uses my "random"


Graphs
 - added one to paper

 
Ikmeans:
 - split in two
 - results: much as before, but twice :)
 - what about those other stopping conditions?
