Hatamlou finally finished
 - added to charts


Onoda:
 - Revisited PCA
 - - problems are consistent: n_components < n_features
 - Revisited ICA
 - - is it really deterministic?
 - - various ones cause a couple of type of errors (consistent; see below)
 - - assume it to be exactly the same ones, but will finalise (errors are different and less consistent)
 - - - IS same for realworld
 - added to charts
 
 
Diss/Paper:
 - how presenting numbers? (can't actually see any yet)
 - need to think of what's in diss vs. paper
 -
 
 
TODO:
 - B&F still yellow
 - K&A needs another session
 -
