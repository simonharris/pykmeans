Standardisation:
 - thanks for help, but trying to understand why. "Can justify" - his words!

Plodding on with running stuff
 - 
 
(Milligan) is Ward Agglomerative clustering deterministic?
  - 

Need scripts (or so) for:
 - verifying/sanity checking output
 - archive/back up output
 - ...

Perhaps talk about what done for:
 - forcing 1,000
 - forcing >= 0.03
 
That thing about algorithms vs LaTeX:
 - my 3 paragraphs idea
 
 
...
 
Stressy emails from dept/faculty

thing about enough originality...
