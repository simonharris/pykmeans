Experiments:
 - ...
 - where possible files/lines of output counted; 
 - - TBC: haven't checked for validity because don't have very clear idea how we'll process output
 - - eg. could be errors/warnings happened (as with erisoglu) while I'm not watching

Onoda PCA:
 - can't run with more clusters than features?

Onoda ICA:
 - still not sure if deterministic, think Renato said yes but output varies...

Khan:
 - what did we say about his column thing?
 - - wrote down something about feature weighting/Matlab 
 - - ran on first column, was fast at least, ARI scores seemed low though
