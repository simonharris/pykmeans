Erisoglu
 - problems with 8/28 ?(empty clusters?)
		./avilatr
		./glass
		./ecoli
		./letterrec
		./optdigits
		./pendigits
		./wbco
		./wineq_red

K&A:
====

Finally replicated author's Java (nb. bug (fix submitted))
 - but is it really what they used
 - - (well, the bug)
 - - diff numbers
 - - code just doesn't seem to fit the paper

I K Means vs. RW
 - 1 (Leaf) doesn't find enough clusters (as per 7 synthetic)
 - 8 simply don't give any output. Left it quite a few day. Python processes go away
		./bloodtrans
		./brtiss
		./letterrec
		./libras
		./spambase
		./wbco
		./wineq_red
		./wineq_white

B&F
 - Be prepared for this, have paper, code wtc (nb overleaf)

Yuan
 - he's right. Fixed. Just need to rerun...
 
* Trying to think of how to display real numbers


Didn't get to checking doc but will do
