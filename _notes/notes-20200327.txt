 - problems with 8/28 ?(empty clusters?)
		./avilatr
		./glass
		./ecoli
		./letterrec
		./optdigits
		./pendigits
		./wbco
		./wineq_red

 

I K Means vs. RW
 - 1 (Leaf) doesn't find enough clusters (as per 7 synthetic)
 - 8 simply don't give any output. Left it quite a few day. Python processes go away
		./bloodtrans
		./brtiss
		./letterrec
		./libras
		./spambase
		./wbco
		./wineq_red
		./wineq_white


B&F
 - Be prepared for this, have paper, code wtc (nb overleaf)
