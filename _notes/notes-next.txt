Erisoglu - addings seems ok
 - but that issue with real world (might be same as the one I mentioned)
 - 2 questions from Paper- ongoing list
B&F -
 - is patented? (find link)


Realworld
 - ikmeans OK
 - just Eris
 
 
Paper 
 - labels might need swome work (eg. superscript, case is inconsistent)
 
Diss (writing it)

 - (general principle) how much detail on implementation eg. data generations: should I mention python and which librfaries etc?
