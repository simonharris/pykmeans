Is it where there are many clusters? Nope
./avilatr - 12
./glass - 6 
./ecoli - 8
./letterrec - 26
./optdigits - 10
./pendigits - 10
./wineq_red - 6

Can see the sum distance growing (good)
Can see it selects the furthest (good)
But it's often a point that's been picked before (bad)


Charts
------

 - talked a little bit - showed mean + error bars
 - - have put std deviation on instead...
