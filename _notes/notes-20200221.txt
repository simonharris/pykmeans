Worked on:
    - Khan
    - IKMeans
    - Better error reporting/catching which datasets etc; reproducing locally
    - Real-world datasets: standardisation; scrapped Isolet + 2 more; added to verify script
    - Erisoglu (see below)
    - Yuan (in progress)

To discuss:
 * Khan
 * Intelligent k-means
 - Erisoglu
 - MacQueen might be useful
 - Yuan
 - ...
 - KKZ (for some reason I made notes with some doubts but seems OK)

* Distance table:
 - I'm *not* using Euclidean (not square rooted) but this is what Renato's Matlab does

Khan:
 - sanity check
 - actually doesn't seem clear what stages he does with 1 column. It isn't stated
 - why use Euclidean distance for 1 number?
 
I K-Means:
 - sanity check
 - was actually a lot closer than I thought
 - - wasn't checking running out of data (Stop cond 1) - DONE
 - - was getting into infinite loops in AP at len(data) == 1 - DONE
 * K=20: 7/1500 only find 19. Can we use the remaining 1493?
 
Starting to fill in RW column:
 - ditched two really troublesome ones
 - issues with ikmeans: 1 didn't find enough, 10 didn't finish
  
Erisoglu:
 - sanity check
 - see earlier notes about distance table
 - Variation Coefficient fails where mean is 0 ie. with standardised data!"
 * - just used stddev for now...sane?
 * Issue with duplicate candidates, hence empty clusters. Delete from _working_ data...sane?
 - - is it related to "more than 2 explanatory features may...when clusters increase"?
 * very end of alg: "For p, initial cluster centers are created..." how? Mean? (It's what I'm trying to do at least!) 
  
  (Once clarified: add this to LaTeX doc as assumptions etc)
 
Yuan...
 
Real-world datasets:
 - ISOLET was just too big, replace with another Musk one
 - 6 (at least; hand, spss, random...) consistently fail on lung cancer + ionosphere and no others
 - removed them
  
Misc:
 - should ARI ever be negative? nb random vs realworld
  
And again:
 - some way of visualising, sanity checking output

Admin 
 - nb KTP job...(keeps getting extended...)
 - Bootcamp vs. "Proficio funding"? see email
