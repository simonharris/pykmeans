Worked on:
    - Khan
    - IKMeans
    - Better error reporting/catching which datasets etc
    - Real-world datasets: standardisation; scrapped Isolet; added to verify script
    - Erisoglu (see below)


To discuss:
 * Khan
 * Intelligent k-means
 - KKZ (for some reason I made notes with some doubts but seems OK)
 - Erisoglu?
 - ...
 - MacQueen might be useful


Khan:
 - actually doesn't seem clear what he does with 1 column. eg. Why use Euclidean distance for 1 number?
 
I K-Means:
  - was actually a lot closer than I thought
  - - wasn't checking running out of data (Stop cond 1) - DONE
  - - was getting into infinite loops in AP at len(data) == 1 - DONE
  * K=20: 7/1500 only find 19. Can we use the remaining 1493?
 
Starting to fill in RW column:
 - ditched two really troublesome ones
  - issues with ikmeans: 1 didn't find enough, 10 didn't finish
  
Erisoglu:
  - Variation Coefficient fails where mean is 0 ie. with standardised data!"
  * - just used stddev for now...sane?
 
 
 Yuan...
 
 
 Real-world datasets:
  - 6 (at least; hand, spss, random...) consistently fail on lung cancer + ionosphere and no others
  - removed them
  
 Misc:
  - should ARI ever be negative? nb random vs realworld
