Khan:
 - actually doesn't seem clear what he does with 1 column. eg. Why use Euclidean distance for 1 number?
 
 I K-Means:
  - was actually a lot closer than I thought
  - - wasn't checking running out of data (Stop cond 1) - DONE
  - - was getting into infinite loops in AP at len(data) == 1 - DONE
  * K=20: 7/1500 only find 19. Can we use the remaining 1493?
